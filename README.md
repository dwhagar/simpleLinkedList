# simpleLinkedList
A simple linked list implementation in C++ without using the STL.

# Why?
I don't intend this for anyone to copy, in fact, I would suggest no one copy this.  However many times C++ students are told to create things that are  already in the STL, so they can learn how.  This is intended to be simple enough and well enough commented that a C++ student can understand what is going on and be able to compare it to their own projects and gain insight and understanding into what is going on.

# Class Definitions
All the class definitions will be kept in their own header declaration and actual implementation file pairs, header files will be .hpp and source files will be .cpp.  This project is done in XCode, however, it is mean to be transferrable to as many situations as possible and should work for any platform using C++ that can use C++11.  The project has a main.cpp which is obstensibly for showing how one might want to use the class.
