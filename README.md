# simpleLinkedList
A simple linked list implementation in C++ without using the STL.

# Why?
I don't intend this for anyone to copy, in fact, I would suggest no one copy this.  However many times C++ students are told to create things that are  already in the STL, so they can learn how.  This is intended to be simple enough and well enough commented that a C++ student can understand what is going on and be able to compare it to their own projects and gain insight and understanding into what is going on.
